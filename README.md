# Assignment Question and Requirements:

**a)** Create an abstract class Vehicle with:

A protected variable _speed.

An abstract method move().

A non-abstract method setSpeed(int speed) to set the speed.


**b)** Create a subclass Car that extends Vehicle:

Implement the move() method to print "The car is moving at $_speed km/h".



**c)** Use encapsulation to prevent direct access to _speed.

**d)** In the main function, create an object of Car, set the speed, and call the move() method.
